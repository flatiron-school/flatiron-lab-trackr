# TODO:

* create lab with name and URL; persist and associate to a cohort
  * need authorization? way to ensure adding to correct cohort--drop down menu?
* On lab showpage, "get PRs" button
* Construct view of lab prs per student, per lab (in each case, group labs by deploy date. it will be rough but better than nothing)***ADD DEPLOY DATE TO LABS TABLE. deploy date will populate when lab is created, we will need to request that info from GH using octokit/github api. 

then--webhooks to get most up-to-date PR code all the time
