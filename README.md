* loading graphic after "get PRs" button is clicked
* style show/hide of pr files
* on lab show: view by directory or specific file
* form for new lab should be on cohort show page
* nav bar links: what do we need?



then:
  * webhooks to get most up-to-date PR code all the time 
  * sidekiq to make getting prs for a lab into a background task
  * search by student, lab for cohort (chris)
